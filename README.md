It is such a pain in the a** for me every time to manually insert the exam date from the table into google calendar so I created this because BK calendar does not work with exam date.

Current bug is with the timezone. You have to manually set the timezone as in the example of the .ics file (the generated file will not contain this line) or else your exam time will be before or after 
many many hours unless you live in the UTC Timezone.
